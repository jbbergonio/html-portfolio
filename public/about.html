<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello and welcome to my About Me page! My name is Jearmaleen Bergonio, and I
  am a Web Developer and Internet Applications student at Fanshawe College in
  London, Ontario, Canada.
</p>

<p>
  I am relatively new to the field of web development but am extremely
  passionate about it. I have been fascinated by technology and the internet,
  and I have always enjoyed tinkering with computers and learning about new
  programming languages. I am now actively pursuing my dream of becoming a web
  developer, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
</p>

<p>
  As a starter in web development, I am currently learning the fundamentals of
  web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and various programming
  languages. My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded and skilled developer
  who can create innovative and user-friendly websites and applications.
</p>

<p>
  Although I am still new to the field, I am eager to learn and grow as a
  developer. I am committed to putting in the work and effort required to
  achieve my goals and am excited to tackle any project that comes my way.
</p>

<p>
  When I am not coding, I love spending time with my family and friends. I am a
  family-oriented person and cherish the moments spent with my loved ones. We
  often engage in fun activities such as playing board games or going on road
  trips to explore new places. I also enjoy reading books on web development and
  participating in online communities to learn from others.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Please feel free to
  contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a project. I
  look forward to hearing from you!
